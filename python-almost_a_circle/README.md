Python - Almost a circle
### General
#### What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
#### How to serialize and deserialize a Class
#### How to write and read a JSON file
#### What is *args and how to use it
#### What is **kwargs and how to use it
#### How to handle named arguments in a function
#### Why private attributes with getter/setter? Why not directly public attribute?
