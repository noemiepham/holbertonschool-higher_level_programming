### Why Python programming is awesome
### What is OOP
### “first-class everything”
### What is a class
### What is an object and an instance
### What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
### What is an attribute
### What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes

### How to bind attributes to object and classes
### What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class

The __dict__ in Python represents a dictionary or any mapping object that is used to store the attributes of the object. They are also known as mappingproxy objects. To put it simply, every object in Python has an attribute that is denoted by __dict__.
