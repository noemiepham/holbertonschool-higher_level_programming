Python - Exceptions

## Why Python programming is awesome

## What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
- An Error is something that most of the time you cannot handle it.
- Exceptions are those which can be handled at the run time.

Syntax error 

```
>>> while True print('Hello world')
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    while True print('Hello world')
                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```


## What are exceptions and how to use them

- An Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program. Whenever there is an error, Python generates an exception that could be handled. It basically prevents the program from getting crashed.
- 
## When do we need to use exceptions

- Exceptions should be used for situation where a certain method or function could not execute normally. For example, when it encounters broken input or when a resource (e.g. a file) is unavailable. Use exceptions to signal the caller that you faced an error which you are unwilling or unable to handle. 

## How to correctly handle an exception

- To handle exceptions, you use the ``try`` statement.

``` 
try:
    # code that you want to protect from exceptions
except <ExceptionType> as ex:
    # code that handle the exception
finally:
    # code that always execute whether the exception occurred or not
else:
    # code that excutes if try execute normally (an except clause must be present)

```


## What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
## How to raise a builtin exception

-  The built-in exceptions can be generated by the interpreter or built-in functions.
- There are several built-in exceptions in Python that are raised when errors occur. These built-in exceptions can be viewed using the local() built-in functions as follows :

```
>>> locals()['__builtins__']
This returns a dictionary of built-in exceptions, functions and attributes.

## When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

- Cleanup actions: Before leaving the try statement, “finally” clause is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not. These are clauses which are intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances.
